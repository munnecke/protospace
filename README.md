# Protospace: Thought experiment Exploring Phase Transitions 

A glass containing water in two phases, liquid and solid.  The same substance going through a phase transition between the two phases. What if dark matter and "normal" space were manifestations of the same underlying "protospace" that we see as containing dark matter as a phase transition from "normal" space?  What if one phase contained an "entropic" space, where our familiar notion of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, causality, and time's arrow all held true.  Another phase, we can call autocatlytic space had the property that adding material to the space made it larger, rather than "using it up" in the entropic space?  This software uses this model to look for signatures of this "glass of water" view of the cosmos.

This repository hosts an ongoing research project investigating the hypothesis that **space itself may exist in multiple thermodynamic or information-theoretic phases**. Inspired by the historical unification of “heat” and “cold” as expressions of thermal energy, this project explores the possibility that **baryonic matter, dark matter, and dark energy** are not fundamentally different substances, but rather distinct **phases of an underlying substrate**—a concept we call **protospace**.

In this framework, space is not a passive void but a **structured medium** capable of undergoing **phase transitions**. We posit that:
- **Entropic space** corresponds to conventional, energy-dissipating dynamics (positive binding index),
- **Autocatalytic space** corresponds to complexity-amplifying, coherence-generating behavior (negative binding index),
- **Dark matter and dark energy** may be manifestations of this autocatalytic phase.

## CMB Voids as Observational Windows

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), particularly as imaged by Planck and upcoming missions like CMB-S4, provides a unique window into these transitions. Voids in the large-scale structure of the universe—regions of low baryonic density—are ideal candidates for observing **phase boundaries** between entropic and autocatalytic regimes.

This repository includes a Google Colab notebook designed to:

- Load and visualize **Planck polarization data**.
- Overlay known **cosmic voids** (e.g., from SDSS/ZOBOV catalogs).
- Extract sky patches near **void edges** and compare them to control regions.
- Compute **information-theoretic metrics** (e.g., entropy, compressibility) as proxies for the organizational properties of space.
- Explore whether **coherence anomalies** or reduced entropy may indicate a transition in the binding character of space itself.

## Goals

This work is a first step in building testable signatures for a broader hypothesis of **cosmological phase dynamics**. By bridging observational data with theoretical speculation, we hope to open a new lens on the structure of the universe—not as a singular static fabric, but as a **dynamic medium with multiple modes of organization**.
